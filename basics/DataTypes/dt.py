# Lists

# The most basic way to initialize list is
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]

# It has its own methods
# append
# insert , has two params
# pop
# remove
# count
# reverse
# and more you can search from docs
my_list.append(6)
my_list.remove(6)
print(my_list)

# Using range to define list
range_list = list(range(1,10))
print(range_list)



# Tuples are similar to lists but they are immutable meaning we cant change them


# Then theres dictionary, where we define data in key value pairs
